BlockingCollection<T>
Multiple threads can safely and efficiently add or remove items from these collections, 
without requiring additional synchronization in user code.
Access to elements of a collection object through extension methods or through explicit 
interface implementations are not guaranteed to be thread-safe and may need to be synchronized by the caller.
